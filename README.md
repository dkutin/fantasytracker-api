# Fantasy Tracker API
An NBA Yahoo! Fantasy Tracker API wrapper that scores and analysis players.
## Available Services
Description of services can be found at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dkutin/fantasytracker/1.0.0
## Motivation
I wanted to get soem experience developing and API, and my fantasytracker application needed a new way to receive and post data, so I chose to create a supplimentary API to my application. I got to get some experience using Swagger, openapi 3 to build the model of the API, and use express and nodejs, interacting with a mysql database to supply and update the data.
## Roadmap
This project is just experimental, though, I still plan to further develop my skills as a developer and:
 - Add remaining endpoints
 - Add authentication for certain endpoints
 - Dockerize application to be run alonside mysql database in the cloud
 - Documentation!
